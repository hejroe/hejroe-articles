# hejroe-articles
A collection of ghost articles relating to technology and data science.

## Introduction
I started to write as a way to help myself learn. Once you have worked on trying to explain something to others you often gain a greater understanding. This is how these articles came about. The oddity here though is that I wrote them but a dear friend published them under their name as I did not want the attention. But now I find myself in a different place, more confident in my writings and opinions. As a result I have taken the step to re-print the pieces I have written over the years in a place that is associated to me.

Each of the articles looks to tackle a particular topic as I followed a path into data science and machine learning in all its guises. This means that there is a very loose thread of an evolving story and understanding. My hope is that these pieces offer some utility to others as they have given me. Ideally it would be to accelerate thinking in a particular direction without introducing constraints.
