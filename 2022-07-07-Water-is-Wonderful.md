# Water is Wonderful
 
Water, the essence of life. A fact that is all too obvious to most of the World. Such is the importance of water to our species that it frequently is given reverence in a mixture of cultures. Gods, Goddess’, mythology, strange beasts, and mysteries are often featured in watery surroundings. Yet water itself is colourless, odourless, and tasteless. Perhaps our senses are dulled to the properties of water else we be in such awe that we fail to look after ourselves. But there again, perhaps not.

Water itself is composed of two hydrogen atoms and a single oxygen atom. At “room temperature” each of these two elements is normally a gas. So, when the two are combined we should expect to see the resulting molecule also wanting to be a gas. Although natural intuition suggests that this may be the case it is not so. As we all know, water is mainly a liquid in a room temperature environment.

Even the story of how water came to be on Earth is not quite as one may think. It was not already here or formed through some geothermal process. It in fact came from objects made of or containing water striking Earth. Asteroids, comets and what not abound. It would also seem that the water came to Earth quite early in its formation, around 4.4 billion years ago.

The fact that water did manage to find its way to earth was a very fortunate thing, for us that is. Yet another wonderful property of water is that it just so happens to be an amazing solvent with an exact neutral pH of 7 in its purest form. Did I mention that water is also sticky? It is so sticky that it defies the forces enacted upon it.

It is almost a certainty that life originated in an environment where water was present. How exactly remains to be seen. But the probability of life being created in an environment other than water and then migrating to water, seems remote at best. In fact, such is the attraction of living in water that some animals evolved to walk on land only to then return to the seas. Whales have knees, just in case you did not know.

This likely feels pretty obvious, rightly or wrongly, to most given the essential nature of water. Without it we do not exist. It makes up 60% of our body. Every cell we have observed requires water to function. Without it a cell at best becomes dormant. Our very survival is dependent on our consumption of water. But the utility of water does not end there.

Over the aeons water has also been a factor in our progression in science. “Eureka” for instance was shouted in the bath. And do not get me started on the number of “great ideas” that were developed on the toilet. But even today water is providing oddities such as the ‘Mpemba Effect’ or snowflake formations that demonstrate only too well that there is more that water can teach us.

When working in the field of AI, ignoring human intelligence is simply not an option. So, when taking a connectionist approach to the problem of intelligence, the stuff that makes up a brain must be considered. In the case of our own brains around 73% is water. Now whether water has some fundamental meaning in intelligence is quite unlikely. But I will leave you with this following quotation:

“Human beings were invented by water as a device for transporting itself from one place to another.” - Tom Robbins – Another Roadside Attraction (1971)
