# Fire
 
At some point in our collective history we “discovered” fire. That is to say that we realised that fire was a thing that could be used as a tool. Over time we then invented tools that made fire more readily available. Flints, oils, wicks and waxes and more besides. Through the aeons “fire” itself has not changed one single bit. But our understanding of fire has.

People like knowledge. It is seen as a power to be used in the World to effect beneficial changes for those wielding it. But for some reason we do seem to prefer stories that are complete. It is not sufficient for most to have an incomplete but practical understanding of something.

This was the case for fire. It was useful but also a very mysterious substance. You need only watch an open fire for a short while before the hypnotic effects of fire take over. As it dances and moves in a generally predictable way but the finer details escaping prediction. Great parts of our collective cultures seemed to venerate fire as a tool from the Gods. As is evident in all manner of rituals that describe a life in both work and belief.

But at some point fire had to be explained by more than the powers of nature or gods. This is where we see fire described as a fundamental element. This idea persisted through out the ages and it was a perfectly functional explanation of what fire is. That is our understanding of fire did not need to be any more advanced given how we were using it. It was only once technology had advanced that the description of fire became an issue again.

In 1667 the Phlogiston Theory was put forward. In this theory certain substance contain phlogiston and that they are dephlogisticated when burnt. It may seem a foolish notion now but at the time it was given serious consideration. Most importantly it was this path of research that lead to the discovery of oxygen. So although not correct it still proved a valuable step in increasing our understanding of fire.

Our contemporary understanding of fire is very much as a chemical process. Of which there are inputs and outputs that are very well understood. Does this mean that the understanding of fire will not change into the future? Of that I am not certain at all. There is still a lot of the World we do not understand completely. So it would be presumptuous to say with absolute certainty that we know everything there is to know about such things. At least at this time.

I personally find it very interesting that our understanding has had to change over time as new information became available. Of equal interest is the transitional periods that had to have occurred with the advent of new understanding and theories. Often these were fraught with hostilities between different houses of thought. This seems to be an unfortunate feature of science at times.

One of the most fascinating aspects is that we can still have done so much with our understanding being so off. The utility of fire is beyond dispute. For thousands of years we have revered and then mastered it. But in much of this time we have understood little of its fundamentals. It has only been with the creation and development of the field of chemistry that we have come to better understand the chemical process that is fire.

This story of fire then raises some interesting questions. Especially when the rate of discovery in the modern World is considered. Fire is but one obvious instance of where our understanding has changed. But what of all the new things we are discovering? How is what we already know altered by what we learn? At what rate does it propagate and what obstacles present themselves?

In my own studies time and time again I seem to have come across instances of “incorrect science” still being presented as current fact. Things about alpha-types, VARK models and software development methodologies still hold considerable sway with some even to today, despite the science proving them falsehoods. Although I do not want that to sound harsh as it probably does. It is just a fact of the way that knowledge is handled at this time.

This is a problem that is well recognised in science as a whole. There does not seem to be a mechanism to rapidly propagate new science as it becomes available. This can then create a situation where you start your academic studies in a field that no longer exists by the time you complete it. An extreme case perhaps. But I would suggest that the likelihood of such a thing as increasing as we do more science.
