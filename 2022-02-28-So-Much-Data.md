# So Much Data
 
Data is a representation of the World that we live in. Sales and purchase orders show intent for commerce. Photos and songs created and exchanged en-mass. An ever-increasing number of devices that “need” to collect data in order to better serve their function. I will confess that I do tend to think of data as also being comparable to knowledge. To add to that, I then see knowledge as being a tool of sorts. This will all make more sense in a few minutes; hang in there.

At one point in time, probably not so long ago in the grand scheme of things, a single person could know everything. At least everything that they needed to know or were concerned about. This by no means makes them correct about their knowledge. But their knowledge of human works would be complete. All local fauna and flora would be well understood. Animals and the fishes of the sea would be studied. Any tool that they needed could be crafted by their own hand.

A single person could know every story and every song. Who was related to who and the history of those relationships. A single mind could know all that there was to know. Of course, there were limits to this knowledge. That is not the point here.

If you were to take a view of considering each piece of knowledge as being a tool of some sorts. A crude analogy I know but bear with me as this may make sense. Thousands of years ago a person would be able to gain proficiency in all the tools known to them at the time. Each tool would be there readily available and understood. These tools can then be combined with each other to create ever increasingly complex tools. Tools make more tools and so on.

As these new tools are being created there is new data that needs to be retained to use them. With the number of tools increasing, we at some point found ourselves specialising. There is a limit to the amount of information that a human brain seems to be able to contain. The specialisation was an obvious and easy solution to this problem.

With specialisation came categories and sets of things. Again, a very natural and easy solution to a growing problem. Schools of academia were created to better impart the information to become proficient in a specialisation. All of these methods has given amazing results over the years but is there a very obvious problem not being addressed here?

Just how much can a human mind be reasonably expected to retain? With an obvious limit to how much can be held then what is the best data to put in? Can we even define an essential core set of data/knowledge/tools?

This data issue is becoming almost exponentially larger as everything seems to generate and demand more data. Much of it is easily dismissed as not being particularly useful but the problem of identifying valuable data remains.

Regarding how much a human mind can store, Wikipedia may be able to help us out with this in a somewhat terrible way. Wikipedia articles currently contain around 4 billion words. An average person can be expected to read 200-250 words per minute. So, 4 billion divided by 250 gives us what turns out to be about 30 years. If you just want to treat it as a day job, then that goes to 90 years. If you want a day off, then it goes up again. This is only to read it by the way. Not to comprehend or use it in any form; just to read.

Additionally, Wikipedia can hardly be seen as the sum of all human knowledge. Not even close I would imagine. Dictionaries, definitions, new knowledge, and words to describe it. All of the oral knowledge that passed down through generations. Discoveries that have been forgotten and research that never sees the light of day.

In recent decades the lines of separation between the different disciplines of science have blurred considerably. Quantum biology is one and behavioural biology is another. It is necessary to have an understanding of multiple fields to a normally high level of detail. This can lead to a situation where what you need to acquire a great deal of knowledge in fast moving fields. It is no wonder that most research papers only have the title read.

There are several issues with the data that we have. But probably the biggest one is what bits of data are actually “true”. Philosophy has been pondering this question for quite some time. The results at this time are inconclusive. In the field of mathematics similar issues were also encountered.

The point remains. A person can only be expected to hold a certain amount of knowledge. It will also take them time to be able to absorb, comprehend and use for it to be useful. With so much data being created every day new methods have to appear. Methods in gathering, proving, and disseminating new knowledge. It is also going to be an increasing challenge to even keep up with all the new knowledge. Could there even be a point where we create so much new knowledge it is not even possible to keep up?
