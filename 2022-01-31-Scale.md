# Scale
 
When working with large sets of data you soon encounter issues relating to scale. Sample sizes too small or too big. Too much detail or not enough. It is quite hard, when in a World where this is apparent, to not think more on scale. Just how big is big or how small is small.

As you would expect this takes you into the realm of physics very quickly.

We have evidence that suggests our Universe is around 13.8 billion years old. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Ebp7IsPW4) 8 min video from the YouTube channel “BRIGHT SIDE” does a very nice job of covering it.

But that is only part of the story of our Universe. With what we know now we can make some predictions as to how it will unfold in the future. In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA) video from the YouTube channel “melodysheep” they describe what we currently think will happen.

Now all of this should be treated with a certain amount of caution given our understanding of the Universe is still changing. The main point of these two examples is that in the first one you think of 13.8 billion years as being a long time. Then you see the second one and realise that it is but a mere instant. A flash of energy and activity before settling into an eternity of nothingness.

Of course, when talking about the Universe you cannot help but address the matter of size. Space is big. Like really really big. In fact, it is so big that we are not even sure we can see it all. So big that it may not be possible to see it in its completeness. This is further complicated by the fact that it seems to be expanding. This becomes more worrisome when you then find out it is expanding faster than the speed of light. Yes, we are seeing less of the Universe each day even though what we can see is getting bigger. As fond as I am of physics it does feel a somewhat silly place at times.

To underline that point we can turn to the very small. Things so small that we need massive machines to even be able to measure them. This is the quantum world. A world where you need to turn some things 720° in order for them to return to the starting position. A world of uncertainty where there is absolute certainty. Yes, confusing I know.

Again, with the large and the small we have cases where you can always go a bit larger or smaller. Whether or not this is meaningful would likely be up for debate.

This then leads us nicely, well kind of, into the field of mathematics. Here we not only go larger or smaller but also into the negative and in-between.

Interestingly there are quite a few infinite numbers that get used all the time in our relatively finite World.  Pi is an obvious one, but they crop up in fractions all the time. Phi is also an irrational number of note. This is the one that relates to the “Golden Ratio”. A number that is said to have a very aesthetic appeal and is ubiquitous in the World.

Prime numbers are worth a mention here. There is an infinite number of prime numbers and they are quite useful. But despite the scale of prime numbers there are things that we can do to make the infinite set of numbers we have a bit smaller. A prime number will not be divisible by two or five. With a simple rule we have reduced our infinite set of numbers by 60%. Interesting that you can reduce a set of infinite numbers by 60% and still have an infinite number of numbers still.

Generally, humans are very good at adjusting scale as needed. We make small things big and big things small all the time. Always the scale is adjusted to something that we find more comprehensible. This is even subject to change with different experiences. The usefulness of this ability is all around us in the things we have been able to make. If we were not able to adjust our thinking to the scale, we wanted to work in we would be in a constant state of disbelief and denial.

It is positively fascinating though that we do possess this ability to adjust scale as required. What mechanisms exist to be able to seamlessly switch between scales and keep a provable chain of thought? That we can consider all the different forms of infinite and not go insane is very interesting. After all, when computers are faced with infinity they normally end in a heap.

In closing I would like to mention the Mandelbrot Set. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk) video from the YouTube channel “Numberphile” explains it far better than I can here. The bit I want to bring your attention too is that such a seemingly simple equation, can result in something so infinitely fascinating and beautiful. It is something so very small and finite that when used expresses infinity. What a wondrous thing it is.
