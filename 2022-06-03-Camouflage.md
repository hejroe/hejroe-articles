# Camouflage
 
I like to be precise when starting to talk about something. Even more so when an idea or concept is ubiquitous. The reason being is that we each individually form our own understanding of a “thing” and for that understanding to change over time. This can easily lead to a situation where although you may think you have a common understanding with others, that this is not in fact the case. Perhaps a good example of this is with the [Mars Climate Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter).

Camouflage, to my surprise, seems to have quite a varied set of definitions of varying suitability. The one that suited my needs the best is “Camouflage: something that is meant to hide something, or behaviour that is intended to hide the truth”. OK, so there are still potentially issues there, but it felt a lot better than the military focused ones.

One of the things you first realise about camouflage is that it is actually a set of strategies. There is no one method that “solves” the camouflage problem. At least, not that I am aware of at this time. The following are just a sample of strategies that can be applied.

* **Being a colour** – Ever wonder why polar bears are white? Their prey never did. OK, so not strictly true, but a point still made.
* **Changing colour** – In this we see a further division in strategies. There are bio-chemical processes such as those found in chameleons. But there is also the light reflecting method employed by octopi.
* **Being a shape** – Stick insects are a wonderful example of something being reliant on looking like something else. In this instance a stick.
* **Changing shape** – Pufferfish get a mention in this. Many within the class have the capacity to dramatically alter their size and shape when provoked into action.

To explain myself better and hopefully quickly. Consider camouflage in all its forms. You have active and passive strategies for instance. Within those there are also additional sub-categories that can be applied. For example, a chameleon and octopus both have active forms of camouflage. This comes in their ability to change their colour to match their respective surroundings. The chameleon does so by a chemical change which can take 20 minutes. Whereas the octopus changes its colour by tensioning its skin to reflect different wavelengths of light. In this change it is more a photo-electric process that adjusts colour. The speed of the change is stunning in some instances.

Now imagine that you had never seen an octopus before but knew of the chameleon. Your understanding of camouflage would be heavily biased towards to your connectionist experience. As there was no other example of camouflage you would not be inclined to think of alternatives. These are of course massive generalisations that only serve to demonstrate the point. That being, that our history is littered with instances of where we stopped looking and asking questions as we “know everything there is about...”.

An organism over its life cycle may even employ a mixture of these strategies. An egg would likely best use being a particular colour and/or shape. Whereas an adult could change shape. Some adult forms will even dispense with the need for camouflage altogether.

With all of this we can see that camouflage is actually a word that references several different strategies that all express a common sentiment. That is, present an alternative to the actual reality.

In evolutionary biology camouflage is seen more as mimicry. It is also perfectly reasonable to describe it as deception. In this, it is more than evident that the realm of knowledge pertaining to camouflage is quite big. We have a mixture of words all relating to similar principles. We also should accept that in a Universe of possibly infinite possibilities, there is more about camouflage yet to be discovered.

This prompts some interesting questions. Do we know everything that there is to know about camouflage, or even all the different types? The “intent” in each instance of camouflage is with the same desired outcome. That is to perpetuate an organisms genetic code. Each type of camouflage is an expression of how to solve a particular problem.

Given that a “problem in nature” can be resolved by using more than one strategy, it seems prudent to ask how many strategies exist in completeness. There is also the consideration that once a successful strategy has been found, others are simply not explored at all.

Some days I even wonder if we co-exist with sentient entities that we fail to perceive.
