# Life Beyond the Grave

This first essay touches on the topic that led to the existence of this site. Quite simply, our corporeal existence is well defined but what of our electronic one? As technology continues at a pace our electronic identity will also become more advanced. Where this may lead is a quagmire of discussion. But what is certain is that it, what ever it may be, is coming.

Some say that you live for as long as you are remembered. As with most sayings there is more than a grain of truth to this. The physical You may cease to exist but the impact on the World and the artefacts you left behind linger. They are of course not you. Just the ripples of who you were. But for those who still live they are formed into a tangible idea of you.

An example of this would be any famous person from history. Take Alexander the Great for instance. His effect on the World is still evident today. His actions acted as the foundation for the path of history to flow in the way that it did. Admittedly the same could also be said for his opponents. But as they saying goes, “winners write history”. Rarely are people as interested in the story of losers.

In this instance we have a person who is long gone in the realist of senses. But their influence and more importantly their perceived identity persists. Interestingly the perceived identity of Alexander the Great will vary depending on how they have been presented. This can vary from region to region for example.

Consideration also has to be given to how a historical figures image may have morphed over time. There are a number of possible reasons for this. Additional texts or information may become available for instance. Or even for pushing an ideological narrative. In this it could possibly be argued that the “memory” of what Alexander the Great “was” is still alive. It is not its own agent however. It is unable to direct its own destiny and is at the whims of others.

With this we see Alexander the Great as a simple tool. A plot device to be used to relay a story of some sort. It would seem inescapable that he does still live on today as he is still having an impact. But of course life in this instance is simply symbolic.

So does this mean Alexander the Great is truly dead? As always how you view this is key. But as always there is more than a single view and they, however many they may be, are likely all equally as valid. Could they vote, get a job or have a driving license? Of course not. But they can still inspire and cause action on the world.

You may well be thinking “how does this relate to today?”. Alexander the Great did not write about himself. Others did that for him. But nowadays we tend to write our own history a lot more. More importantly it is more persistent and complete than at any other time before. We create our online histories on social media platforms, online gaming and other online activities.

Where does this version of you go once you die? It still exists and there is no reason to think that it would ever be removed. At least in potential given the continued increases in data storage and compression. This means this electronic shadow of your former self will continue on.

This leads to other interesting questions. Who will own this residual electronic shadow? With further reaching EULAs or ToS users of social media platforms may even be giving away more than they realise. Will we have a greater need for services to scrub the internet of our existence? Is that even possible any more?

Another aspect for consideration is the potential for our electronic selves to change, grow or even replicate. For example, if there were only photos of you on the internet the visual representation is of course two dimensional. But what if you were to then take those flat images and map them onto a three dimensional model? Your electronic self would have taken on a different, more complex form.

To close on a thought which is firmly fixed in the realm of sci-fi. What if these ever evolving electronic representations of people become complex enough to at least give the appearance of consciousness?

It would be very easy to write considerably more on this topic. That will have to wait until another time. It is interesting though that even though I am in the field of computing, I seem to be ushered to other disciplines. In this instance I feel as if I am wading into philosophy and property law. This was not expected when I started in computing, although it is surprisingly welcome.
