# Why I Find Boring Things Interesting
 
Take any two objects you may have to hand, with one in each hand. Now move the objects about each other in any manner you see fit. Now wasn’t that amazing? No? Well let me see if I can change your mind on that, if even only ever so slightly.

The story starts 13.8 billion years ago, or there about. Lots of “stuff” burst into what would become our Universe. Once all this “stuff” had a chance to spread out and cool down it started to do some things. One of which was for the formation of stars. Now this is all incredible stuff as it is. The amount of anti-matter and matter was thought to be equal and should have cancelled each other out. But by some strange quirk of fate, we ended up with about 5% of our known Universe being the very useful matter.

The processes that these stars underwent gave rise to new elements. New formations of neutrons, protons and electrons coalescing into more complex arrangements. In another astoundingly good piece of fortune some of these stars were really big. And when they went bang, they created a whole set of even more complex, heavier, elements.

With all this vigorous activity in the early Universe, it is of no surprise that there is a lot of dust about the place. Some of this dust went on to form new stars, but not all of it. In another remarkably good piece of luck some of this dust happened to form in clumps. Clumps became bigger clumps and so on until you had something more planet sized.

Some of these planets just so happened to be in the right spot to act as a really big chemistry set. There are even planets that had an active core that also facilitated this process. Amazingly others also had weather systems and electrical storms and atmospheres. Incredibly there were even some with protective electromagnetic shells that shielded the surface from the harshness of solar ejections.

On those select few planets that were a hot bed of chemical activity some started to form more complex molecules. With increasing complexity these formed the likes of amino acids. Building blocks for proteins were formed all through the simple rules of physics and chemistry. These biological components then formed into ever more complex arrangements. Ultimately forming the first and simplest of life forms.

Through this we see even more emergence. Unexpected behaviour from systems with seemingly simple rules. Ever increasingly complexity but with underlying principles of simplicity that resisted corruption and failure. All stemming from raw elements with chemistry naturally occurring. Protective shells of proteins or minerals were formed and made a home of by other chemical mechanisms. The complexity and seeming co-operation being attractive forces.

Some “things” wanted to move around more. They grew limbs and nervous systems. With these came perception of state, planning, prediction and more besides. The need to exchange ever more complex information was required. All the time surrounded by the materials required to make a tool chain to enhance life.

In this time all manner of dangers have hurtled past our home. Even then not always missing. Just ask the dinosaurs. It should be noted that technically dinosaurs were the winners of life but ended up losing due to a technicality. Lucky for us.

Equally there are aspects of our species that have allowed for the creation of what we have today. Despite all the unsavoury elements we still have cooperated to the degree where we are stunningly close to being able to free ourselves from many forms of scarcity. Given how some humans are inclined to behave towards each other makes this even more incredible.

All of this serendipity has lead us to here. You are reading this and perhaps you did even pick up two objects. Maybe you did move them about each other. Maybe now you even think it is amazing, if only a tiny bit.

The thing I have found for myself is that once I went on that journey of discovery there was no coming back. From that point on I could not help but think of things in a very different way. Flitting from perspective to perspective in order to better understand and use the tools we have collectively created.

As a consequence of this I will find myself asking “interesting” questions in some seemingly normal activity. For instance, if I look at a cloud for any period of time I soon start thinking about other aspects of clouds. Their density, potential energy, volume, how many elephants a cloud would represent, or how many fish are currently suspended in clouds about the World? Not questions that are going to change the World in any fundamental way, just interesting questions from seemingly mundane things.
