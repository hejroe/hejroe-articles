# Hidden in Plain Sight
 
When you look at the history of the sciences over the ages you will spot periods where invention and discovery seemed rife. People were able to step outside and “discover” something by simply going to a place or by mashing two substances together. Often such periods are present at a time of a fundamental shift in the sciences, or even in society itself.

Those times that there is a flurry of activity are frequently heralded by a single discovery or invention. For instance, think of the discovery of the number zero. All of a sudden there is a new thing that can be applied to almost everything. This then forms the basis of a gold-rush of discovery.

With such gold-rushes there are often nuggets and rich veins that go unnoticed in the bustle. It is probably best to offer a few examples as evidence.

Sorting things is something that we have been doing for thousands of years. Arranging things and classifying them comes very naturally to some. The utility of sorting things is also well proven. So, you would think that the sphere of knowledge regarding sorting would be very complete. Oddly this seems to not be the case. Timsort was not created until 2002 and “library sort” until 2006. Both of which encompass a very simple and arguably obvious feature in each.

So what about something like human organs? After all, over the ages bodies have been picked apart with great fervour. Surprisingly the last one found was just in 2020 and is called “tubarial salivary glands”.

Nature of course offers a huge amount of yet undiscovered knowledge. Until 1890 we thought that all life was reliant on photosynthesis, then along came chemosynthesis. However, this was not proven until 1977, but once proven it fuelled many minds to ponder what other types of life may be possible.

These examples are only to show how and what such things are. There are many other examples in almost any discipline you can think of.

## But it gets better.

Over the last 300 years our understanding of the World has shifted greatly. Rather than there being less things to explore and discover, there are far more. With every passing day, even more potential for discovery is created. The reason for this is that answering a question in science will often result in the potential for more questions. For each problem solved another ten problems/questions seem to magically appear.

Contrary to what some may think, there is more to discover now than there has been ever before. So, what will you discover?
